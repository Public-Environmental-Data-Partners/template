# Template

This repo is a template for PEDP repositories containing original PEDP projects (as opposed to forked/cloned/archived projects). Replace this paragraph with a description of the repo.

# How to start contributing to this repo
* Instructions go here
* Developer setup (if relevant)
* Communication channels (if relevant)

**Suggestions for additional components of Readmes:**
* A "How to use" section if the repo's project is a tool or website
* A link to the [good-first-issue](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Agood-first-issue+user%3APublic-Environmental-Data-Partners) label (this link across PEDP, or a specific link for the repo)
* Highlight "ready" label on issues to mean "this is an issue that is ready to work on and needs an owner"
* Additional badges at the top, such as code quality indicators


**When using this template, please look through all of the files to ensure they apply to the new repo.**
